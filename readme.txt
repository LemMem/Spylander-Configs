If you have the rgl configs installed already, simply drag all the files here into your server's tf/ folder, and you should be good to go.
If you don't have them installed, install them here: https://github.com/RGLgg/server-resources-updater

If you are an RGL Representative and wish for these configs to be taken down, please contact me on discord. @🍋lem🍋#3012
